\section{Concolusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we study the distributed subgraph matching algorithm \cliquejoin. Discovering the limitations of \cliquejoin that can not handle labelled subgraph matching, we propose \gencliqjoin to generalize it by extending its cost evaluation function to labelled graphs so that it can generate optimal join plan for labelled query graphs. We further improve its performance by migrating \cliquejoin from Map-Reduce to \timely dataflow system, which can significantly reduce the I/O cost. We conduct extensive experiments on both unlabelled and labelled matching. The experimental results show that the generality and performance of \cliquejoin are highly improved after performing the two optimizations we propose in this paper.
